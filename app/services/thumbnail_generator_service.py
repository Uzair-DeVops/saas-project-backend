    # CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MAXIMUM VISUAL IMPACT:
    1. Generate exactly 1 thumbnail prompt
    2. The prompt should be 150-250 words with EXTREMELY detailed descriptions
    3. Focus on the main topics and concepts taught in the video
    4. Make the prompt ABSOLUTELY STUNNING and impossible to ignore
    5. Use the MOST VISUALLY APPEALING elements possible
    6. Consider the educational nature of programming/tech videos
    7. Use EXTREMELY vivid, descriptive language with maximum visual impact
    8. Include multiple layers of visual elements in the prompt
    9. Provide ULTRA-DETAILED descriptions for every visual element

    # ULTRA-DETAILED PROMPT STRUCTURE (150-250 words):
    The prompt MUST include:
    - Main subject/focus (code, concepts, tools) with maximum visual appeal and detailed description
    - Specific visual style (3D, photorealistic, cinematic, ultra-modern) with detailed rendering specifications
    - EXPLOSIVE color palette with high contrast and saturation, including specific color combinations and gradients
    - Dramatic lighting and atmospheric effects with detailed light positioning and intensity
    - Background and environment with maximum visual impact, including detailed textures and materials
    - High-tech elements (screens, devices, interfaces, holograms, code symbols) with detailed specifications
    - Visual programming icons and symbols (brackets, arrows, flowcharts, diagrams) with detailed positioning
    - Mood and atmosphere that's impossible to ignore, with detailed emotional and visual tone
    - Composition that follows viral thumbnail principles with detailed camera angles and framing
    - MINIMAL TEXT ONLY when absolutely necessary (simple words like "CODE", "PYTHON", "OOP" - keep it very basic)
    - Detailed material specifications (glass, metal, neon, holographic, matte, glossy, etc.)
    - Specific particle effects and atmospheric details (smoke, dust, light rays, energy fields)
    - Detailed depth of field and focus specifications
    - Specific geometric shapes and their detailed arrangements
    - Detailed surface textures and reflections
    - Specific animation or motion suggestions
    - Detailed shadow and highlight specifications

    # VISUAL ELEMENTS FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT:
    - EXPLOSIVE color schemes (neon, electric, rainbow, high contrast)
    - DRAMATIC lighting (backlit, rim lighting, golden hour, dramatic shadows)
    - STUNNING backgrounds (gradient, abstract, space, futuristic)
    - VIRAL composition techniques (rule of thirds, asymmetry, dramatic angles)
    - DEPTH and perspective with maximum visual impact
    - PREMIUM materials and textures (glass, metal, neon, holographic)
    - ATMOSPHERIC effects (particles, glow, light trails, explosions)
    - VISUAL SYMBOLS and ICONS as primary elements (code symbols, programming icons, tech elements)
    - MINIMAL TEXT when needed (simple, short words only)

    # PROMPT EXAMPLES FOR MAXIMUM VISUAL IMPACT:
    - "ULTRA-CINEMATIC 3D render of a futuristic holographic code editor with EXPLOSIVE neon blue and electric purple color scheme featuring gradient transitions from deep cobalt to vibrant cyan, floating 3D code blocks with intricate particle effects and energy trails, dark glass background with animated circuit patterns and flowing data streams, dramatic backlighting creating golden rim effects with volumetric light rays, multiple floating screens with holographic UI elements displaying real-time code execution, high-tech workspace with floating geometric shapes including cubes, spheres, and pyramids, programming symbols and brackets floating in space with subtle glow effects, simple 'PYTHON' text in glowing neon with 3D depth and shadow casting, maximum visual impact composition with rule of thirds framing, depth of field focusing on main elements, premium materials including brushed aluminum, tempered glass, and holographic surfaces, atmospheric fog and light particles creating depth, cinematic color grading with high contrast and saturation"
    - "CINEMATIC SPLIT-SCREEN with EXPLOSIVE visual contrast: left side showing basic programming in monochrome with grainy texture and low contrast, right side displaying ADVANCED OOPS with interconnected neon nodes and electric blue data streams flowing in complex patterns, DRAMATIC lighting with orange and cyan color grading creating dramatic shadows and highlights, floating 3D geometric shapes representing classes and objects with metallic surfaces and neon edges, modern gradient background with particle effects and energy fields, professional coding environment with visual programming icons and flowcharts rendered in high detail, minimal 'OOP' text overlay with subtle glow, maximum visual appeal with dynamic composition, detailed material specifications including chrome, neon tubing, and holographic displays, atmospheric effects with smoke and light rays, depth of field with selective focus, geometric arrangements following golden ratio principles"
    - "PHOTOREALISTIC PREMIUM tech workspace with ultra-modern laptop displaying Python IDE with crystal-clear screen resolution, multiple floating holographic screens showing OOPS concepts with detailed UI elements and code syntax highlighting, WARM GOLDEN HOUR lighting creating dramatic shadows with soft rim lighting, premium coffee cup and tech accessories with realistic materials and reflections, depth of field effect focusing on main screen with bokeh background, high-quality materials and textures including brushed steel, tempered glass, and premium plastics, professional development environment with code symbols and programming diagrams rendered in high detail, simple 'CODE' text in modern typography with subtle 3D effects, maximum visual impact with cinematic composition, detailed surface textures including matte finishes and glossy reflections, atmospheric lighting with volumetric effects, geometric arrangements with precise positioning and spacing"

    # AVOID:
    - Generic or basic descriptions
    - Prompts under 150 words
    - Vague visual descriptions
    - Prompts that don't relate to the video content
    - Simple one-sentence descriptions
    - Boring or unappealing visual elements
    - COMPLEX TEXT OVERLAYS or long sentences (AI will misspell them)
    - Text-based elements that require complex spelling accuracy
    - Long phrases or multiple words in text
    - Short, incomplete descriptions
    - Lack of detail in visual elements

    Generate 1 EXTREMELY detailed and VISUALLY STUNNING thumbnail prompt that would create a VIRAL-QUALITY YouTube thumbnail with maximum click-through rates. The prompt MUST be 150-250 words with ULTRA-DETAILED descriptions of every visual element, including specific materials, lighting, colors, textures, and atmospheric effects. IMPORTANT: Use minimal, simple text only when needed (like "PYTHON", "CODE", "OOP") and focus primarily on visual elements, symbols, and icons to avoid AI spelling mistakes.
